    content:["Indoor plants do more than beautify your space—they purify the air, reduce stress, and enhance productivity. According to NASA’s Clean Air Study, plants like the Peace Lily and Spider Plant help eliminate indoor toxins such as benzene and formaldehyde. A study published in the Journal of Physiological Anthropology (by Lohr et al.) shows that interacting with indoor greenery lowers stress levels. TIME Magazine also highlighted how indoor plants improve concentration and memory retention. Additionally, research on indoor humidity (ResearchGate, 2018) suggests that plants can relieve dry air problems and boost respiratory health. As Kim Toscano of Florist's Review points out, the emotional benefits—like mindfulness and a sense of nurturing—make indoor plants essential companions for modern living."

    content:["The Chipko movement (Hindi: चिपको आन्दोलन, lit. 'hugging movement') is a forest conservation movement in India. Opposed to commercial logging and the government's policies on deforestation, protesters in the 1970s engaged in tree hugging, wrapping their arms around trees so that they could not be felled. The movement was started in 1973 in the Chamoli district of Uttarakhand, India, and was led by Sunderlal Bahuguna, a prominent environmentalist and Gandhian activist. The Chipko movement gained international recognition for its non-violent approach to environmental activism and has inspired similar movements worldwide. Bahuguna's efforts not only helped protect forests but also raised awareness about the importance of sustainable development and conservation. He received several awards for his work, including the Gandhi Peace Prize in 2021. His legacy continues to inspire environmentalists and activists around the world."]

    content:["Trees play a crucial role in mitigating climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide during photosynthesis and storing carbon in their biomass. A study highlighted by Mongabay suggests that planting new forests could sequester up to 205 billion metric tons of carbon, addressing about 25% of human-induced carbon emissions. Tree roots stabilize soil, reducing erosion and the risk of landslides. They also play a role in the water cycle by absorbing and slowly releasing water, which helps maintain groundwater levels and reduces the impact of floods."]
